Some of the ideas listed in #2 would require some special handling for version control providers.

History, especially, would need to use something like [libgit2](https://libgit2.github.com/) (and other equivalent libraries).

These may be out of scope for the 1.0 release, and possibly even in contradiction with the project's core values (not clearly defined at the time of writing).
